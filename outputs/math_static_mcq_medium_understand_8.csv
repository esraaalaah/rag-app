gen-math-static-understand-0,math,static,mcq,What is the term for the force that opposes the motion of an object in contact with a surface?,"['Friction', 'Gravity', 'Tension', 'Normal Force']",0,Friction is the force that resists the sliding or rolling of one surface over another.,understand,medium
gen-math-static-understand-1,math,static,mcq,Which of the following best describes static equilibrium?,"['All forces acting on an object are balanced', 'An object is in motion', 'Forces are unbalanced causing acceleration', 'Only gravitational forces are acting']",0,Static equilibrium occurs when an object is at rest and all forces acting on it are balanced.,understand,medium
gen-math-static-understand-2,math,static,mcq,"If an object is in static equilibrium, what can be said about the net force acting on it?","['It is zero', 'It is positive', 'It is negative', 'It varies with time']",0,"In static equilibrium, the net force acting on an object must be zero.",understand,medium
gen-math-static-understand-3,math,static,mcq,Which of the following scenarios illustrates static friction?,"['A book resting on a table', 'A car accelerating on a road', 'A ball rolling down a hill', 'A person pushing a heavy box that does not move']",0,"Static friction prevents the book from sliding off the table, keeping it at rest.",understand,medium
gen-math-static-understand-4,math,static,mcq,What is the primary condition for an object to remain at rest according to Newton's first law?,"['No net force acts on it', 'It is subject to gravitational force', 'It is in motion', 'It is acted upon by an external force']",0,Newton's first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted upon by a net external force.,understand,medium
gen-math-static-understand-5,math,static,mcq,"In a system where two forces act in opposite directions on an object, what must be true for the object to be in static equilibrium?","['The forces must be equal in magnitude', 'One force must be greater', 'The object must be in motion', 'The forces must act at an angle']",0,"For the object to be in static equilibrium, the two opposing forces must be equal in magnitude.",understand,medium
gen-math-static-understand-6,math,static,mcq,What is the effect of increasing the mass of an object on the static friction force acting on it?,"['It increases the static friction force', 'It decreases the static friction force', 'It has no effect', 'It depends on the surface type']",0,"Increasing the mass of an object increases the normal force, which in turn increases the static friction force.",understand,medium
gen-math-static-understand-7,math,static,mcq,Which of the following statements about static and kinetic friction is true?,"['Static friction is usually greater than kinetic friction', 'Kinetic friction is greater than static friction', 'Both are equal under all conditions', 'Static friction does not exist']",0,"Static friction is typically greater than kinetic friction, which is why it's harder to start moving an object than to keep it moving.",understand,medium
